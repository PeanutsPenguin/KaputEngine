## About
Kaput Engine is a school Project where we had to code a **Game Engine + an editor** and create a game with it in 4 months. We were a team of two people, me and Jean-Enrick Audet (Excellent programmer check out his [git][jeanGitUrl] and [Linkedin][LinkedinJeanUrl] !). We had a lot of funs and a lot of problems coding it but we did it and we're super proud of it. It contains a ton of feature like :   

- PBR rendering
- Reflection
- Picking depuis la SceneView
- Importation de fichiers externes
- Format .kasset
- Multithread
- ECS
- And a lot more !
